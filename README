Atlas is an Arduino library for controlling and querying Atlas
Scientific embedded sensor circuits.

    https://www.atlas-scientific.com/

This library is intended to be used with the Atlas Shield, a
multiplexer board based on the 74HC4052 serial multiplexer chip. The
shield has four ports for four sensor circuits. 

=== Requirements ===

You will need to install AltSoftSerial, which can be found here :

    http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html

Please note that AltSoftSerial does not let you choose RX and TX pins.
On the Uno and related boads, TX is on pin 9, RX is on pin 8, and
pulse width modulation will be disabled on pin 10.

=== Usage ===

This library is intended as a high-level interface, and does not
provide access to every feature of the sensor circuits. This example
is basically the whole interface :

    #include <Atlas.h>
    #include <AltSoftSerial.h>
    
    Atlas A = Atlas();
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin( 9600 );
      // get version strings for each sensor
      Serial.println( A.version( PORT0 ) );
      Serial.println( A.version( PORT1 ) );
      Serial.println( A.version( PORT2 ) );
      Serial.println( A.version( PORT3 ) );
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // get temperature corrected readings
      Serial.println( A.read( PORT0, 23.4 ) );
      Serial.println( A.read( PORT1, 23.4 ) );
      Serial.println( A.read( PORT2, 23.4 ) );
      Serial.println( A.read( PORT3, 23.4 ) );
    }


=== Inspirational Quote ===

A big leather-bound volume makes an ideal razor strap. A thin book is
useful to stick under a table with a broken caster to steady it. A
large, flat atlas can be used to cover a window with a broken pane.
And a thick, old-fashioned heavy book with a clasp is the finest thing
in the world to throw at a noisy cat.

    -- Mark Twain
